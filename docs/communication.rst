How to use IRC?
----------------

Read `how to register your nickname <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_use_IRC>`_.

Register your nickname
-----------------------

Remember to register your nickname, you can follow `this guide <http://www.wikihow.com/Register-a-User-Name-on-Freenode>`_.

Rules to follow
---------------

Be nice to others. 

Always type full English words, no sms speak in any FOSS communications. That
means no more 'u' or 'r', instead type 'you' or 'are'.

Though are few sort forms which are acceptable in IRC.
