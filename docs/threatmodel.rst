Trying to protect all your data from everyone all the time is impractical and
exhausting. But, do not fear! Security is a process, and through thoughtful
planning, you can assess what’s right for you. Security isn’t about the tools
you use or the software you download. It begins with understanding the unique
threats you face and how you can counter those threats.

In computer security, a threat is a potential event that could undermine your
efforts to defend your data. You can counter the threats you face by
determining what you need to protect and from whom you need to protect it.
This process is called “threat modeling.”

This guide will teach you how to threat model, or how to assess your risks for
your digital information and how to determine what solutions are best for you.

What might threat modeling look like? Let’s say you want to keep your house
and possessions safe, here are a few questions you might ask:

What do I have inside my home that is worth protecting?
--------------------------------------------------------

Assets could include: jewelry, electronics, financial documents, passports, or photos

Who do I want to protect it from?
----------------------------------

Adversaries could include: burglars, roommates, or guests


How likely is it that I will need to protect it?
-------------------------------------------------

Does my neighborhood have a history of burglaries? How trustworthy are my
roommates/guests? What are the capabilities of my adversaries? What are the
risks I should consider?

How bad are the consequences if I fail?
----------------------------------------

Do I have anything in my house that I cannot replace? Do I have the time or
money to replace these things? Do I have insurance that covers goods stolen
from my home? How much trouble am I willing to go through to prevent these
consequences?

Am I willing to buy a safe for sensitive documents? Can I afford to buy a
high-quality lock? Do I have time to open a security box at my local bank and
keep my valuables there?

Once you have asked yourself these questions, you are in a position to assess
what measures to take. If your possessions are valuable, but the risk of a
break-in is low, then you may not want to invest too much money in a lock.
But, if the risk is high, you’ll want to get the best lock on the market, and
consider adding a security system.

Building a threat model will help you to understand threats that are unique to
you and to evaluate your assets, your adversaries, and your adversaries'
capabilities, along with the likelihood of risks you face.


What is threat modeling and where do I start?
==============================================

Threat modeling helps you identify threats to the things you value and
determine from whom you need to protect them. When building a threat model,
answer these five questions:

- What do I want to protect?
- Who do I want to protect it from?
- How bad are the consequences if I fail?
- How likely is it that I will need to protect it?
- How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?

Let’s take a closer look at each of these questions.

What do I want to protect?
===========================

An **asset** is something you value and want to protect. In the context of
digital security, an asset is usually some kind of information. For example,
your emails, contact lists, instant messages, location, and files are all
possible assets. Your devices may also be assets.

*Make a list of your assets: data that you keep, where it’s kept, who has
access to it, and what stops others from accessing it.*

Who do I want to protect it from?
==================================

To answer this question, it’s important to identify who might want to target
you or your information. A person or entity that poses a threat to your assets
is an **adversary**. Examples of potential adversaries are your boss, your
former partner, your business competition, your government, or a hacker on a
public network.

*Make a list of your adversaries, or those who might want to get ahold of your
assets. Your list may include individuals, a government agency, or
corporations.*

.. warning:: Depending on who your adversaries are, under some circumstances this list might be something you want to destroy after you’re done threat modeling.

How bad are the consequences if I fail?
========================================

There are many ways that an adversary can threaten your data. For example, an
adversary can read your private communications as they pass through the
network, or they can delete or corrupt your data.

The motives of adversaries differ widely, as do their attacks. A government
trying to prevent the spread of a video showing police violence may be content
to simply delete or reduce the availability of that video. In contrast, a
political opponent may wish to gain access to secret content and publish that
content without you knowing.

Threat modeling involves understanding how bad the consequences could be if an
adversary successfully attacks one of your assets. To determine this, you
should consider the capability of your adversary. For example, your mobile
phone provider has access to all your phone records and thus has the
capability to use that data against you. A hacker on an open Wi-Fi network can
access your unencrypted communications. Your government might have stronger
capabilities.

*Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data.*


How likely is it that I will need to protect it?
==================================================

Risk is the likelihood that a particular threat against a particular asset
will actually occur. It goes hand-in-hand with capability. While your mobile
phone provider has the capability to access all of your data, the risk of them
posting your private data online to harm your reputation is low.

It is important to distinguish between threats and risks. While a threat is a
bad thing that can happen, risk is the likelihood that the threat will occur.
For instance, there is a threat that your building might collapse, but the
risk of this happening is far greater in San Francisco (where earthquakes are
common) than in Stockholm (where they are not).

Conducting a risk analysis is both a personal and a subjective process; not
everyone has the same priorities or views threats in the same way. Many people
find certain threats unacceptable no matter what the risk, because the mere
presence of the threat at any likelihood is not worth the cost. In other
cases, people disregard high risks because they don't view the threat as a
problem.

*Write down which threats you are going to take seriously, and which may be too
rare or too harmless (or too difficult to combat) to worry about.*


How much trouble am I willing to go through to try to prevent potential consequences?
=======================================================================================

Answering this question requires conducting the risk analysis. Not everyone
has the same priorities or views threats in the same way.

For example, an attorney representing a client in a national security case
would probably be willing to go to greater lengths to protect communications
about that case, such as using encrypted email, than a mother who regularly
emails her daughter funny cat videos.

*Write down what options you have available to you to help mitigate your unique
threats. Note if you have any financial constraints, technical constraints, or
social constraints.*

Threat modeling as a regular practice
======================================

Keep in mind your threat model can change as your situation changes. Thus,
conducting frequent threat modeling assessments is good practice.

.. note:: Create your own threat model based on your own unique situation. Then mark your calendar for a date in the future. This will prompt you to review your threat model and check back in to assess whether it’s still relevant to your situation.
