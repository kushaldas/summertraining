Before you start
=================

The motto of `dgplug <https://dgplug.org>`_ is "Learn yourself and teach
others". The summer training effort is a huge part of this. We try to learn
together and help each other. Before you jump into this, there are a few small
things one should know.

How to ask for help?
---------------------

There will be many times in a day when you will need some help, may be to solve
a problem, or to learn a new thing. Before you go and ask for help, you should
first search for a solution. Most of the times, you will find the answer
yourself. We suggest everyone to use `DuckDuckGo <https://duckduckgo.com>`_
search engine. This particular search engine does not track you, and focused to
protect your privacy.

If you open the site for the first time, it you show you ways you can enable it
as the default search engine in your browser. That should be the first thing to
do. Go ahead, and enable DuckDuckGo as the default search engine.

There is no magic mirror!
--------------------------

If you just come online and ask help by saying "I have an error.", no one will
be able to help you. Because, we need to see the exact error you can see in
your computer. Best way to ask for help is by providing as much information as
possible along with the question. If the error message is more than 2 lines,
then one should use a pastebin server (like `Fedora modernpaste service
<https://paste.fedoraproject.org/>`_) and paste the whole error message there,
and then only provide the URL to the pastebin in the question.

Learn touch typing
-------------------

`Touch typing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing>`_ is one of the most
important thing to learn before you jump into programming or commands to control
a server. Typing errors are the most common cause behind the errors we get in
computers. Typing efficiently and fast will help you through out the life.

`Here is a blog post <https://kushaldas.in/posts/touch-typing.html>`_ to find out
more about the topic.


History of Free and Open Source Software
-----------------------------------------

Read `this post <https://kushaldas.in/pages/hacker-ethic-and-free-software-movement.html>`_
to learn about the history, then also read `this log <https://dgplug.org/irclogs/2017/Logs-2017-09-20-15-56.txt>`_
to hear from Jim Blandy about his experience. Free Software movement is the reason why
we have this community standing together. So, make sure to go through the history first.


Download Tor browser
---------------------

The next important step is to `download Tor Browser <https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en>`_.
To start using it, follow `these steps <https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#linux>`_. You may have a
lot of questions about `Why should we use Tor?`, through out the summer training we will
have many discussions on this. But, to understand the basics, have a look at this `page <https://www.eff.org/pages/tor-and-https>`_.
